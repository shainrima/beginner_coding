# Can Place Flowers

## Problem Description

You have a flowerbed represented by an array of integers where:

- `0` means the plot is empty,
- `1` means the plot is already planted with a flower.

You want to plant `n` new flowers in the flowerbed without violating the rule that **no two flowers can be planted in adjacent plots**.

Return `true` if it is possible to plant `n` new flowers in the flowerbed without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule; otherwise, return `false`.

### Example
Input: flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1], n = 1
Output: true
